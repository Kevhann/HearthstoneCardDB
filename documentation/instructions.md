## Instructions

- In the application you can view cards and decks that other people have made. In order to create your own, you need to log in. Create a new account. After this, you can create your own decks and cards.

- From the card list, you can add cards to the decks. Note that class cards (cards other than neutral) can only be added to decks of the same class.

- Once logged in, you can sort the results by either (global) favourite items, or your own created items. You can also delete or modify cards and decks.
